Double Pendulum Motion Simulation 

in this project i used rk4 numerical apporximation to create a simulation of a double pendulum. Rk4 takea a weighted average of 4 different slope estimates accross an interval in order to estimate the nature of the graph. Due to the number of varables impoacting the movement of the pendulam, a exact value cannot be used. in this code the user can change the intial angles, the length of the rod,
gravitational acceleration, and the mass of the ball and observe how the path of the pendulum can change.
